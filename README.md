# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to map earthquakes using a GeoJSON and to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by marker size and color.

This map provides 3 viewing styles: "Streets", "Satellite", and "Dark Style". Additionally, the map can display all data sets at once or display a combination of data sets by selecting the boxes next to the data sets.

By selecting "Tectonic Plates" and "Major Earthquakes" the result appears less cluttered.

When a user clicks on an earthquake marker or a tectonic plate boundary line, a pop-up provides more information.

The pop-up associated with the earthquake marker shows the magnitude and the location of the earthquake.  Additionally, the radius and color of the marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake.  The pop-up associated with the tectonic plate shows the abbreviated name of the boundary line and a source of information on that plate to provide a resource for further study.
