# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to map earthquakes using a GeoJSON and to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by size and color.

This map provides 3 viewing styles: "Streets", "Satellite", and "Dark Style". Additionally, the user can choose to view all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates.  ![menu]<img src = ("https://github.com/laurlen2112/mapping_earthquakes/blob/main/resources/legend.png" width=100)>
