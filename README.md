# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to map earthquakes using a GeoJSON and to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by marker size and color.

This map provides 3 viewing styles: "Streets", "Satellite", and "Dark Style". Additionally, the user can choose to view all data types or choose to filter any combination of "all earthquakes", "tectonic plates", and "major earthquakes".

An example of each view with all datatypes selected is provided below.

By selecting tectonic plates and major earthquakes the result appears less cluttered.

When a user clicks on an earthquake marker or a tectonic plate, a pop-up provides more information.

The pop-up associated with the earthquake marker shows the magnitude and the location of the earthquake.  Additionally, the radius and color of the marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake.  The pop-up associated with the tectonic plate shows the abbreviated name and a source of information on that plate.
